The Venator application is for recording, viewing, and filtering logs and spans
from Rust programs instrumented with the tracing crate.

This is currently in a "beta" state; bugs and quirks are to be expected but
functionality should be complete. Bug reports and future feature requests are
welcome.

Installation:

```
cargo install venator-app
```

Run:

```
venator
```
